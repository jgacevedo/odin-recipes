    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There’s a new soup place in town and, rumor has it, it’s the best in the city. The gang frequents the stand for its fantastic crab bisque and turkey chili, only for the owner (“The Soup Nazi”) to ban them—one after another—for violating his strict ordering protocol. George asks for bread, Jerry’s girlfriend shows too much PDA, and Elaine bangs on the counter. Eventually, Elaine drives The Soup Nazi out of the city when she finds his secret recipes in an armoire he gave to Kramer.</p>
